# Phase 5 Task 1: Sentiment Analysis Fix - Test Report

**Date:** October 26, 2025
**Task:** Fix Sentiment Analysis (News Aggregator Returns 0 Articles)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

---

## Issue Summary

**Problem:**
- News aggregator was returning 0 articles
- All sentiment analysis results showed "neutral" with 50% confidence
- No variation in sentiment across different tickers

**Root Cause:**
- yfinance library API structure changed
- Old code accessed: `item.get("title")`, `item.get("publisher")`, `item.get("providerPublishTime")`
- New API structure: Data nested in `item["content"]` object

---

## Solution Implemented

### File Modified: `backend/services/yahoo_finance.py`

**Changes to `get_news()` method:**

```python
# OLD (incorrect):
news_items.append({
    "title": item.get("title"),
    "publisher": item.get("publisher"),
    # ...
})

# NEW (correct):
content = item.get("content", {})
provider = content.get("provider", {})

news_items.append({
    "title": content.get("title"),
    "publisher": provider.get("displayName"),
    "publish_time": content.get("pubDate"),
    "summary": content.get("summary"),
    # ...
})
```

**Key Updates:**
1. Access data from `content` nested object
2. Get publisher from `content.provider.displayName`
3. Use ISO format `pubDate` instead of Unix timestamp `providerPublishTime`
4. Added `summary` field extraction
